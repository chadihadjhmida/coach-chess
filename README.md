## üöÄ Overview  
This project is a **robotic chess arm** that combines cutting-edge AI technologies to provide an interactive, educational, and exciting chess-playing experience. The arm is powered by **LLaMA 3 70B** and **Stockfish**, offering features like real-time board analysis, move recommendations, and chess coaching through an intelligent assistant named **Lua**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features  
- **Smart LED Chessboard**: LEDs light up on the board to highlight possible moves.  
- **AI-Powered Vision System**:  
  - A camera captures the board's state.  
  - A custom AI model converts the board image (JPG) into FEN notation for analysis.  
  - Based on the [Chess CV project](https://github.com/Rizo-R/chess-cv).  
- **Lua: The AI Chess Coach**:  
  - **Easy**: Analyzes every move for beginners.  
  - **Medium**: Highlights missed opportunities or brilliant moves.  
  - **Hard**: Provides feedback only when requested.  
  - Answers chess-related questions and explains why certain moves are good or bad.  
- **Stockfish Integration**:  
  - Leverages the power of Stockfish for move calculation and strategy evaluation.

## üí° How It Works  
1. **Board Detection**:  
   - The system captures the current state of the board using a camera.  
   - The AI model processes the image and generates FEN notation.  
2. **Move Analysis**:  
   - Lua provides move suggestions, evaluates positions, and answers questions based on the board state.  
3. **LED Feedback**:  
   - LEDs on the board indicate possible moves, making gameplay more intuitive.  
4. **Robotic Arm**:  
   - Executes moves based on AI recommendations or user input.
